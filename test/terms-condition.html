							<p class="details-disc">Giltxchange and the User are aware that although there is no legal bar or impediment to trading in Virtual Currencies in India at the moment, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has issued a press release no. 2013-2014/1261 dated 24th December 2013 whereby it has stated that "The creation, trading or usage of VCs including Bitcoins, as a medium for payment are not authorised by any central bank or monetary authority. No regulatory approvals, registration or authorisation is stated to have been obtained by the entities concerned for carrying on such activities. As such, they may pose several risks to their users". The press release further states that the RBI is still "examining the issues associated with the usage, holding and trading of VCs under the extant legal and regulatory framework of the country". The full text of the said press release can be found at Here The User is hereby made aware of the nebulous legal situation regarding Virtual Currencies and Giltxchange shall not be liable for any proceedings against the User in any Court of law or before any governmental, administrative, regulatory, judicial or quasi judicial authority. </p>
							<p class="details-disc">Although the press release by the RBI mentions the risks associated with all virtual currencies including Virtual Currencies, it does not specifically bar them.

							<h5>RISKS</h5>
							<p class="details-disc">The User acknowledges that he is fully aware of the risks involved in online trading activities, including the risk involved due to unauthorized access or any technical difficulties. Furthermore, in a technical environment, should an error occur with respect to the tracking of any account holding or order entry, the true, actual and correct transaction or position may not be restored. It is the User's responsibility to ensure account correctness and accuracy and to contact Giltxchange immediately in respect of any discrepancies. </p>
							<p class="details-disc">Users are advised to use the content and data on the website for the purpose of information only and rely on their own judgment while making investment or trading decisions. In case Giltxchange gives any information on the website, such information shall not be considered as advice of any kind and the User shall use its own judgment to make all decisions. </p>
							<p class="details-disc">Giltxchange does not make any personal recommendations. The information on our website is provided solely to enable Users to make their own investment or trading decisions and does not constitute a recommendation to buy, sell or otherwise deal in Virtual Currencies. </p>
							<p class="details-disc">The price and value of investments in Virtual Currencies and the income derived from them can go up or down and you may not get back the capital invested. Changes in the rate of exchange may have an adverse effect on the value, price and value of your investment. Past performance is not necessarily an indicator of future performance. The services and investments in Virtual Currencies may have tax consequences and it is important to bear in mind that Giltxchange does not provide any tax advice regarding Virtual Currencies and the increase or decrease in their value. The level of taxation depends on individual circumstances and such levels and bases of taxation can change. You should consult your own Tax Advisor in order to understand any applicable tax consequences. </p>
							<p class="details-disc">Virtual Currencies trading has specific risks, which are not shared with other official currencies, goods or commodities in a market. Unlike most currencies, which are supported by government reserves or other legal entities, as well as commodities such as silver and gold, Virtual Currencies is a "flat" currency, which is only backed by mathematics, technology and trust. The currency is absolutely decentralized, which means there is no authority that can take corrective measure to protect the Virtual Currencies value in a crisis or issue more currency. When using Virtual Currencies - traders put their trust in the digital, decentralized and mostly anonymous system, which relies on P2P networking and cryptography to maintain its integrity. Trading in Virtual Currencies is susceptible to irrational or rational bubbles or absolute loss of confidence, which could collapse demand/supply. Any actions, even remotely connected to Virtual Currencies can crash confidence in this currency, such as unexpected changes imposed by the currency developers, a government crackdown, the creation of a superior competing Virtual Currencies alternative, or even a deflation or inflation spiral. Confidence might also collapse because of various technical problems: if the anonymity of the system can be compromised, funds lost or stolen, or in the event that hackers or governments become able to prevent Virtual Currencies transactions from settling. Giltxchange shall not be liable for any loss caused to the User due to any of the risks related to trading in Virtual Currencies, whether currently known or unknown. </p>
							<p class="details-disc">Virtual Currencies purchased using a bank account or credit card or any other deposit method may be reversed at a later time, for example, if such a payment is subject to a chargeback, reversal, claim or is otherwise invalidated. A Virtual Currencies transaction may be unconfirmed for a period of time (usually less than one hour, but up to one business day) and never complete if it is in a pending state. </p>
